Questo script permette di connettersi alla repository ufficiale di QGIS per scaricare, estrarre e caricare in QGIS un'esercitazione a disposizione per studenti e professionisti.

The provided script requires to build dependancies through the "pip install" command. You can find 'em in Dependancies.txt. Then you must run it with official python interpreter (tested with Python 3.12) with "python exercise.py" command in your terminal.
The script allow you to connect to official QGIS.ORG website, and download a 300 MB exercise that will be automatically extracted and loaded in QGIS (Ensure QGIS is installed in your Windows device)
Finally, when download/extract/load operation will complete, the script will display the QGIS Training Manual webpage from QGIS.ORG in your default browser.

If your Windows device lack Python and you don't want to install it, I've created an indipendent PE that you can run without python interpreter and without worrying about dependancies.
You can test the source code and the PE in a VMware environment if it look suspicious or you don't trust it.
Good study, and good work.
